These are basically modifications on the equipment used or on the amount of tumescent fluid infiltrated like 'Wet' and 'Super-wet' Liposuction for Abdomen. Ultrasonic Liposuction for Abdomen employs ultrasonic energy to emulsify fat which is then removed by Liposuction for Abdomen cannula. Because of the ultrasonic energy and the production of heat in this procedure, there is always a possibility of skin burns and fluid accumulation under the skin (seroma). These are commonly performed under general anaesthesia. Laser Liposuction for Abdomen is an untested and untried method. It also produces heat under the skin and has the potential for causing skin burns. So far there are no significant studies or reviews on the advantages, if any, by this method. Liposuction for Abdomen after 'freezing' the fat called 'Cryo- Liposuction for Abdomen' is a very new development and is still an untested and untried method with no significant studies."
