These variations may be minor or major. The visible asymmetry is not much appreciable if the variations are minor. However, in cases where the asymmetry is very gross, the surgery results may also be not symmetrical for obvious reasons. Extreme asymmetry is seen in a well-developed breast on one side only while the other side is more or less flat. This is called Unilateral Gynecomastia.

          On the side where the breast is larger, more breast tissue that is fat, glands and skin will be present. Complete symmetry after surgery in such individuals is very difficult to achieve. Natural body responses which lead to skin and tissue shrinkage will be effective only to that extent. Therefore a person having gross bilateral asymmetry before surgery should not expect complete symmetry on both sides after surgery. Some right-left differences will remain. However, over a period of time, which may be a few years, these differences may reduce further and acceptable degrees of symmetry may be gained.`,
