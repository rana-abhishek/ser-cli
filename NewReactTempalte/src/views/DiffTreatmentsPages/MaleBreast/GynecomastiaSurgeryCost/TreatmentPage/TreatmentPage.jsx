        firstdesc: `Gynecomastia surgery cost varies from surgeon to surgeon and from clinic to clinic or hospital to hospital. The primary considerations of determining gynecomastia surgery cost are the experience of the surgeon and size and condition of gynecomastia. More experienced surgeons usually charge more because they give you better results with minimal side effects. Large size gynecomastia surgery costs more than a small size.

          There may be other factors for the surgeon to consider before deciding upon the charges like sagging of the breasts, previous incomplete or complicated surgeries and expected technical difficulties during surgery. Therefore surgeon must examine you first before quoting gynecomastia surgery cost to you.
          
          Sometimes, pictures of chest taken from front and side views can give the surgeon a rough idea of the status of your gynecomastia. Therefore, you should ask the surgeon whether he will agree to make an assessment by looking at properly taken pictures of chest, sent by Email. But, you must understand that accurate assessment can be done only by a physical examination.
          
          Surgery usually costs more when performed in a hospital setting because the charges include anaesthesia, operating room facilities, room charges or other related expenses besides the surgeon’s fees. However, surgery is cheaper when it is done in an office setting by the tumescent awake technique because admission in hospital is not required. It is performed like an OPD (outpatient procedure).
          
          A surgeon’s charges are usually based on his experience, technique of procedure and the geographical location of his facility.`,
